Arithmetic Expression Tree Evaluation
This Java project demonstrates the evaluation of arithmetic expressions using expression trees.
The ArithmeticTreeDriver class contains methods to create an arithmetic expression tree, perform inorder and postorder traversals, and evaluate the expression.

Overview
Arithmetic expression trees are binary trees used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each internal node in the tree represents an operator, while the leaf nodes represent operands. By traversing the tree in different orders, we can obtain different representations of the expression.

Features
Create Expression Tree: Constructs an arithmetic expression tree from a given expression.
Inorder Traversal: Performs an inorder traversal of the expression tree.
Postorder Traversal: Performs a postorder traversal of the expression tree.
Evaluate Expression: Evaluates the arithmetic expression represented by the expression tree and returns the result.
Usage
To use the ArithmeticTreeDriver class:

Instantiate the Driver: Create an instance of the ArithmeticTreeDriver class.

Run the Main Method: Execute the main method in ArithmethicTreeDriver to demonstrate the creation, traversal, and evaluation of arithmetic expression trees.

View Results: View the results printed to the console, including the inorder and postorder traversals of the expression tree, as well as the evaluated result of the expression.
